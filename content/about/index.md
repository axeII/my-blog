I began my journey at Kiwi.com as an intern on the platform team, where I managed GitLab and CI/CD processes for the entire organization. Collaborating closely with the security and DevOps teams provided me with invaluable insights. I took a temporary break to complete my master's degree in IT and Economics. After graduation, I started as a backend Python engineer but eventually found my way back to DevOps.
I take great pleasure in working with tools like Kubernetes, although it can be challenging at times 🤣. I'm also passionate about security and sometimes participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. In my free time, I play with [my home lab project](https://github.com/axeII/home-ops), where I am practicing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps methodologies.

Currently, I am a DevOps engineer at KM company. My daily job is to take care of cloud, git pipelines and flow, and at last make sure that from security perspective everything is in place.
